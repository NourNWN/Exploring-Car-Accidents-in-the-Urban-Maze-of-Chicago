# Exploring-Car-Accidents-in-the-Urban-Maze-of-Chicago

Our mission is to conduct an exploratory analysis of car accidents in the city of Chicago using a comprehensive dataset consisting of six main components: car accidents, individuals involved, vehicles, police district boundaries, central business district boundaries, and city street boundaries. By leveraging the power of hidden data, we aim to gain valuable insights into the patterns and factors influencing car accidents within the city.  

Through this analysis, we seek to highlight the importance of public safety, traffic road planning, and law enforcement. By understanding the complex network of car accidents, we can identify high-risk areas and common factors that contribute to accidents. With this knowledge, efforts can be directed towards improving road safety measures, infrastructure planning, and traffic management to create a safer and more harmonious transportation environment.

Datasets:
Traffic Crashes, Streets Center Lines, Police Beats Boundaries, CBD Boundary
